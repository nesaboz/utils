To show images in markdown cells:
```jupyter
![][path to the image]
```
for example:
```jupyter
![](assets/example.png)
```
will produce:
![](assets/example.png)

One can also use HTML to show images (`src`) with lot's of flexibility: 
- to change the width add `width` (as string)
- for reference add `id`
```jupyter
<img width="500" caption="Session_rate" src="images/session_rate.jpg" id="figure_id"/>
```

then refer to the figure as: 
```text
[name to show](#figure_id)
```
 
also can refer to URL images: (for example in Google Colab we have to replace the reference by it's github link):
```

```
