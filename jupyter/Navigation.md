## Help
To see parameters: `SHIFT + TAB`
For help use `?` before or after the command.
For autocompletion: `TAB + TAB`
Merge cells, select cells then: `Shift + M` ``


For raw text use:
```text
```text
```
and close with
```text
<```> but without the <> (that's the only one text that can't be displayed I guess!)
```


To add some empy space in markdown one can use:
~~~
&nbsp;
~~~

%autoreload 2
