There are many shells one can use, Mac default is `zsh` (located at `/bin/zsh`). I set up PyCharm to use it as well in the `Preferences\Tools\Terminal\Shell Path`

Bash/zsh comment is the same as python: `#`

```zsh
# To open Pycharm from terminal:
open -na "PyCharm.app" .
# To open a finder from terminal:
open .
```

To open terminal from folder I added a shortcut:
`Control + Alt + Shift + T`

## Count files

To [count files](https://devconnected.com/how-to-count-files-in-directory-on-linux/) in a folder from terminal:
```zsh
ls /etc | wc -l
```
recursively:
```
find <directory> -type f | wc -l
```

for example:
```
ls '/Users/nenad.bozinovic/work/Frame/elasticity_logs' | head -4
```

## Zip/Unzip

To [zip/unzip gz](https://www.cyberciti.biz/faq/unpacking-or-uncompressing-gz-files/):

```zsh
zip -d filename.gz  # unzip filename
gzip filename  # zip it back
gzip -k filename  # to zip it and keep original
```

## Download

To download a file from URL:
```zsh
!curl -OL <URL>
```

## Paths

Print path:

```zsh
echo "${PATH//:/$'\n'}"
```

## Homebrew

[Homebrew](https://brew.sh/) is a package manager for macOS, it might have some unique packages that pip doesn't have, to install `wget` for example:

```zsh
brew install wget
wget https://your.link.png
```

## pip

To install package:
```zsh
pip install torch torchvision tensorboard
```

When using `[]` with `pip` it is important to use `""` to avoid shell parsing for example:
```zsh
pip install "mpl_interactions[jupyter]"
```
